1. IAC (Infrastructure as Code) --> Immutable Infrastructure
2. IAC tools --> Terraform, CloudFormation 
3. CloudFormation is AWS native, built in, in house tool 
4. CF supports 2 languages. 1) JSON and 2) YAML (Yet Another Markup Language)

Why we have to suffer with CloudFormation (JSON is ugly)? AWS console so easy/beatiful/cute/attractive. 


If we have 20 VPCs? Building manually is a tidious process.

1. Functional programming --> First Class Citizens of coding 
2. Cloud Formation template is ready. But there is a small bug/defect in the code. This fix called HotFix. 
3. Hotfix fixes usually takes only couple of hours or maybe couple of days 
4. Fix which takes at least 2 weeks (1 Sprint) called BigFix. 
5. aws cloudformation validate-template --template-body file://vpc_iac.json 
6. aws cloudformation deploy --template-file vpc_iac.json --stack-name vpc-stack --parameter-overrides KeyName=bastion
7. aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name vpc-stack

CI/CD and benefits 
Lets find out how Continous Integration (GitHub) and Continous Deployment work together and benefits. 
1. CI/CD --> glue in the project 
2. It helps to identify the problems as early as possible
