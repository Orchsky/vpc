4. ICMP protocol --> This utility helps to monitor network host and other devices.

8. chmod 400 ~/Downloads/<pem file> --> locks down the permissions 
9. ssh-add -K ~/Downloads/<pem file> --> adds pem file to ssh identity 
10. ssh -A ec2-user@<public-ip> --> Login to Instance 
11. Once logged in to Bastion run --> ssh ec2-user@<private-ip>
